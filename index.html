    Joseph started his career in the United States Navy, where he learned key viable skills as an Aviation Machinist’s Mate. His duties included repairing and/or replacing engine components which greatly honed his attention to detail. After his time in the military, Joseph went back to school to pursue his bachelor’s in Business Administration and successfully utilized his skills in IT as a business analyst consultant. After a brief hiatus away from his business analyst role, it is his desire to return to a more IT oriented role and discover a new passion in software engineering, eventually leading to a Master’s degree in computer science.
